# JELLOG.IO Platform 4.1 Final Has Been Released!

[JELLOG Framework](https://jellog.io/) and [JELLOG Commercial](https://commercial.jellog.io/) 4.1 versions have been released today.

## What's New With 4.1?

Since all the new features are already explained in details with the [4.1 RC Announcement Post](https://blog.jellog.io/jellog/JELLOG.IO-Platform-v4.1-RC-Has-Been-Released), I will not repeat all the details again. See the [RC Blog Post](https://blog.jellog.io/jellog/JELLOG.IO-Platform-v4.1-RC-Has-Been-Released) for all the features and enhancements.

## Creating New Solutions

You can create a new solution with the JELLOG Framework version 4.1 by either using the `jellog new` command or using the **direct download** tab on the [get started page](https://jellog.io/get-started).

> See the [getting started document](https://docs.jellog.io/en/jellog/latest/Getting-Started) for details.

## How to Upgrade an Existing Solution

### Install/Update the JELLOG CLI

First of all, install the JELLOG CLI or upgrade to the latest version.

If you haven't installed yet:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g DataGap.Jellog.Cli
```

To update an existing installation:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g DataGap.Jellog.Cli
```

### JELLOG UPDATE Command

[JELLOG CLI](https://docs.jellog.io/en/jellog/latest/CLI) provides a handy command to update all the JELLOG related NuGet and NPM packages in your solution with a single command:

```bash
jellog update
```

Run this command in the root folder of your solution.

## JELLOG Community

We started to get more contributions by the community for the [JELLOG Community](https://community.jellog.io/) contents. Thank you all!

We will be adding **Video Content** sharing system in a short time. We are planning to create short video contents, especially to explore the new features in every release. Again, we will be waiting video contributions by the community :)
