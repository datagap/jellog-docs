Since all the new features are already explained in details with the [4.0 RC Announcement Post](https://blog.jellog.io/jellog/JELLOG.IO-Platform-v4.0-RC-Has-Been-Released-based-on-.NET-5.0), I will not repeat all the details again. Please read [the RC post](https://blog.jellog.io/jellog/JELLOG.IO-Platform-v4.0-RC-Has-Been-Released-based-on-.NET-5.0) for **new feature and changes** you may need to do for your solution while upgrading to the version 4.0.

Here, a brief list of major features and changes;

## Creating New Solutions

You can create a new solution with the JELLOG Framework version 4.0 by either using the `jellog new` command or using the **direct download** tab on the [get started page](https://jellog.io/get-started).

> See the [getting started document](https://docs.jellog.io/en/jellog/latest/Getting-Started) for details.

## How to Upgrade an Existing Solution

This is a **major version** and requires some **manual work**, especially related to **.NET 5.0** and **IdentityServer** 4.0 upgrades.

* See the [MIGRATION GUIDE](https://docs.jellog.io/en/jellog/latest/Migration-Guides/Jellog-4_0) that covers all the details about the upgrade progress.

## New Guides / Documents

We are constantly improving the documentation. Our purpose is not only document the JELLOG Framework, but also write architectural and practical guides for developers.

### Implementing Domain Driven Design

[Implementing Domain Driven Design](https://docs.jellog.io/en/jellog/latest/Domain-Driven-Design-Implementation-Guide) is a practical guide for they want to implement the DDD principles in their solutions. While the implementation details rely on the JELLOG Framework infrastructure, core concepts, principles and patterns are applicable in any kind of solution, even if it is not a .NET solution.
